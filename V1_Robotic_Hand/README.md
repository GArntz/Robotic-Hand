# **Description**
V1 of the Robot Hand project was built for a high school robotics assignment. The goal was to create an animatronic with at least 2 degrees of freedom (DOF), LED light feedback, and use some 3D printed parts consisting of <100g PLA filament total. Created with help from Frankie Realle and Connor Houser.

## **Design Statement**
Design and build an animatronic mascot that responds to stimuli and uses servo motors for movement and LEDs for lighting effects, controlled by an Arduino microcontroller.
The animatronic should demonstrate at least two distinct motions (such as head turning and nodding) and include lighting effects (such as blinking eyes or accent lights).
The design must be safe, functional, and fit within the size limits of the classroom 3D printer. The design will be lightweight, functional, and use no more than 100 grams of filament for 3D-printed parts.
The project must follow the Engineering Design Process and be completed by the end of the semester.
